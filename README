Important, this wiking version for redmine 2.5+ requires two call hooks in RM core, which probably not yet accept by RM comunity:

++ app/views/wiki/edit.html.erb
Line 29:
  <%= call_hook(:view_wiki_form_bottom, { :page => @page, :form => fp, :content => @content }) %>
(It's before end of block fields_for @page)

++ app/views/wiki/show.html.erb
Line 72:
  <%= call_hook(:view_wiki_sidebar_top, {:page => @page}) %>
(It's the first line of sidebar block)
